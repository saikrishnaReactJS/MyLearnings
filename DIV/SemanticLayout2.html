                <p>Food nourishes us, delights us, and generally fuels our daily lives. In the era of social media, a gorgeously plated dish also makes for great content. However, coming up with something fun and exciting to say about that stunning 100 percent organic beet salad you just photographed for Instagram isn’t always easy. Sure, you could say it was yummy (accurate), but wouldn’t it be nice to break out some more interesting words to describe food the next time you upload a photo of your dinner to the ‘gram.</p>
                <p>Expanding your vocabulary should be a life-long process. Words can be downright magical, which makes it all the more fun to discover new ones. Whether you’re helping a teen prep for their SAT, writing a short story, or just looking for new ways to spice up your social media captions, getting a crash course in descriptive words for food is a great place to start. Plus, learning the difference between apéritifs and a bouffage is sure to impress your foodie friends.</p>
